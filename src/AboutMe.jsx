    <Section title="About Me">
      Hi there! I'm Michael. Once upon a time, it's 2004. I know next to nothing
      about computers. A friend of mine tells me that he was taking an Intro To
      Programming class, and I replied,{" "}
      <em>
        "OMG, that sounds so boring!! Why would you want to sit in front of a
        screen and just type text all day long?!"
      </em>{" "}
      Fast-forward three years. I discover Battlestar Galactica. I'm hooked by
      artificial intelligence and resolve build a Cylon!
      <br />
      <br />
      I never ended up bulding a Cylon. Instead my journey took me through lots
      of linguistics, some physics and cellular biology, to Russia, to China, to
      investing in real estate, and of course to a career in IT. I've worked in
      web development for about 7 years now, from tech support, to QA and
      testing, to test automation, to developing and leading training workshops
      for development teams, to coaching students at Concordia Bootcamps.
      <br />
      <br />
      Now after a brief career shift into the Personal Development space, and
      then a pandemic sabbatical to focus on some leadership training, the
      latest leg of my journey has brought me back to frontend development. I
      love watching as something emerges from code to something that I can see
      and interact with right away, and find creative solutions to delivering
      exactly the right user experience!
      <br />
      <br />
      I've only just started to put together this portfolio (and I'm not going
      to pretend that I have great design chops â€” I'm more a builder... give me
      a design and I'll build it! I'll revamp this once I've found some designs
      that speak to me to riff off) but it will evolve and grow along with me!)
      For the moment, here are a few of my recent projects I've made as I've
      gotten back into coding!
